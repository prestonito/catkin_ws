Introduction to Robotics workspace in Linux (using Singularity and ROS 1)

This is a collection of code from my Introduction to Robotics class at King's College London in the Fall of 2021. It's a combination of code from professors
and code that I edited. This class gave an introduction to ROS using Linux. Due to the hybrid format of the class, we used Stage, a robot simulator,
instead of an actual physical robot. Some of the projects in the semester included using actionlib to send position and orientation goals, using YOLO detections 
to send goals, using SMACH state machines to organize long tasks, and using speech processing/text-to-speech to send goals while saying its status.
